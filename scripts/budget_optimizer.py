    Response model (per channel) is a HILL / saturation function — NOT linear:

    where ``coef_i`` is the Ridge elasticity, ``gamma`` the Hill slope, and
    ``tau_i`` a per-channel half-saturation point set to the channel's current
    average spend (so the model agrees with the linear elasticity near the
    observed operating point but exhibits diminishing returns far from it).
    Total revenue = sum_i(revenue_i) + intercept.

    This fixes the earlier "linear response" issue: under a purely linear
    objective the optimum is a trivial corner solution that just moves all
    budget to the highest-elasticity channel and extrapolates far outside the
    spend range the model was trained on. A saturating response makes the
    optimal allocation non-trivial and bounds the implied revenue gain.
